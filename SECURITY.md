# Security Guidelines for Uzzap Messenger

This document outlines security best practices and guidelines for the Uzzap Messenger application.

## Environment Variables

- **NEVER** commit sensitive information like API keys, tokens, or credentials to version control
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- For local development, use a `.env` file (which is gitignored)
- For production, use the appropriate secrets management system for your deployment platform

## Authentication

- Always verify user authentication before allowing access to protected resources
- Implement proper session timeout (currently set to 1 hour)
- Use Supabase's built-in authentication mechanisms
- Never store passwords in plaintext or use weak hashing algorithms

## Database Security

- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies to restrict access to data
- Always validate user input before inserting into the database
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Regularly review and audit database access patterns

## Input Validation

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use the validation utilities in `lib/validation.ts`
- Implement both client-side and server-side validation
- Be particularly careful with message content to prevent XSS attacks

## Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Use the rate limiting functionality in `lib/supabase.ts`
- Monitor for abuse and adjust rate limits as needed

## Error Handling

- Never expose detailed error messages to users
- Log errors securely without exposing sensitive information
- Implement proper error boundaries in the UI
- Use structured error handling with try/catch blocks

## Secure Communications

- Always use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate the origin of requests where appropriate

## User Privacy

- Only collect necessary user information
- Implement proper user blocking functionality
- Allow users to delete their accounts and data
- Comply with relevant privacy regulations

## Security Updates

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for all used libraries
- Have a process for emergency security patches

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@uzzap.com. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

## Security Checklist for Developers

Before submitting code:

1. Ensure no sensitive information is hardcoded or committed
2. Validate all user inputs
3. Check for proper error handling
4. Verify authentication and authorization
5. Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
6. Ensure rate limiting is applied where needed
7. Verify that database queries use RLS appropriately
